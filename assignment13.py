#Challenge: Use a loop structure to compare characters from both ends of the string to determine whether it is a palindrome.
#===================================
#Description: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and then checks whether it is a palindrome.
# A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.
from assignment11 import user_input

#input user enters string
user1_input = input("check palindrome:")
#processing
# break input into individual characters. split string
#iterate through characters
# check to see if it is same backwards use operator.?
# if user1_input is same forward and backward print palindrome
#challaenge use loop
