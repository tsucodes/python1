Description: Develop a program that prompts the user to enter the number of rows for a pattern and then prints a pattern of asterisks (*) in the form of a right triangle.
"""

# prompt the user to enter the number of rows
rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows:"))

# prompt the user to enter the pattern character
char = input("Enter the character to use for the pattern")

for i in range(1, rows +1):
    for j in range(i):
        print(char, end='')
